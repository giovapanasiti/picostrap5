// Use this file to overwrite the basic Bootstrap variables and add your own variables
// To overwrite a Bootstrap variable you donÂ´t have to touch the Bootstrap folder.
// Just copy a variable from /sass/bootstrap5/_variables.scss, paste it here and edit the value.
// Remember that to customize base color values and main variables, you can just launch the WordPress Customizer
// By the way, you'd be better editing this file in the CHILD THEME.

// SOME EXPERIMENTS for your quick testing:
//$primary:teal;
//$body-bg: darkgrey;
